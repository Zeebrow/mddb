# mddb

A markdown parser which treats your markdown files as a single database

Use a markdown file to keep a list of projects you want to do.

plan is to take out a slight chunk of `src/wishlist` and make a markdown db.
so, tests are not going to be written against anything click-related.

## Build


## Install 

```bash
pip install -e
```

# Database

a collection of markdown files



# Entry

a markdown heading 

## repr

## iter

returns list of subheadings



# index

a list of tagged entries

# tag 

TBD




# algo

## markdown headings are entries

`entries(Entry)` is recursive 

## hashtags (the twitter kind) are git trees

to mark an element and its children in an index, do something special
